- RxJS operators are functions that enable us to manipulate observable streams in various ways. 

- For example, we can use operators to transform the values emitted by an observable, filter out unwanted values, combine multiple observables into one, or perform side effects. 

- Operators are applied to observables using the pipe method, which returns a new observable that is the result of the operator's action. 

- Operators can be chained together to create complex operations on observable streams.
