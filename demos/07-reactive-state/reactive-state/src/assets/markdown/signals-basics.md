- Observables are powerful but complex data structures that enable reactive programming and change detection in Angular applications. However, they also come with some drawbacks, such as the need to use zones, pipes, and subscriptions to handle them properly. 

- Signals are a simpler and lighter alternative to observables that can make your code more readable and maintainable. 

- Signals are values that change over time and can be used directly in the template without any extra syntax. 

- In this chapter, you will learn how to create and use signals, how to define computed signals that depend on other signals, and how to create effects that run side effects when signals change.
