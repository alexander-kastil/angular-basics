- `BreakpointObserver` is a service that provides a responsive API for the calling code to check if it matches a specific `media query`. It can be used to dynamically change the layout or behavior of the application based on the screen size or orientation. 

- For example, in `sidenav.service.ts`, we use BreakpointObserver to change the sidenav mode from `over` to `side` when the screen width is larger than a given `width`, and vice versa. This way, we can create a responsive sidenav that adapts to different devices and resolutions.

  ```typescript
  watchScreen = this.breakpointObserver
    .observe([Breakpoints.XSmall, Breakpoints.Small])
    .pipe(
      tap((matchesBreakpoint) => {
        console.log(matchesBreakpoint);
        this.visible.set(matchesBreakpoint.matches ? false : true);
        this.position.set(matchesBreakpoint.matches ? 'over' : 'side');
      })
    );
  ```
