- This demo uses a [.NET Core Api](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0?) to get skills. To start it, navigate to: `../00-APIs/SkillsApi/` & execute:

```
dotnet run
```

> Note: The api is also available as a [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/arambazamba/skillsservice/general) in case you don't have .NET Core installed.
